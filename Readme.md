# ControlSystemBars

**ControlSystemBars** is a powerful and flexible custom , production-ready abstraction to control
Android system bars (status & navigation) and apply safe inset paddingâ€”while keeping your
implementation hidden.

## Gradle Integration

### Step A: Add Maven Repository

In your project-level **build.gradle** or **settings.gradle** file, add the JitPack repository:

```
repositories {
    google()
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
```  

### Step B: Add Dependencies

Next, include the library in your app-level **build.gradle** file. Replace x.x.x with the latest
version [![](https://jitpack.io/v/hamzaious/ControlSystemBars.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#hamzaious/ControlSystemBars)

```
implementation("com.github.hamzaious:ControlSystemBars:v1.0.0")
```

## Implementation

### Usage Example:

```
controlSystemBars(
            type = SystemBarsAction.SHOW_SYSTEM_BARS,
            topInsetPadding = true,
            bottomInsetPadding = true
        )
```

### Use input to modify:

```
    // Show both **status** and **navigation** bars (no IME change). 
    SystemBarsAction.SHOW_SYSTEM_BARS,
```
```
    // Hide **status** bar, show **navigation** bar (no IME change). 
    SystemBarsAction.HIDE_STATUS_SHOW_NAV,
```
```
    // Hide **navigation** bar, show **status** bar (no IME change). 
    SystemBarsAction.HIDE_NAV_SHOW_STATUS,
```
```
    // Hide both **status** and **navigation** bars (immersive-style; IME unchanged). 
    SystemBarsAction.HIDE_SYSTEM_BARS,
```
```
    // Hide the on-screen keyboard (IME) only; system bars unchanged. 
    SystemBarsAction.HIDE_KEYBOARD,
```
```
    // Show the on-screen keyboard (IME) only; system bars unchanged. 
    SSystemBarsAction.HOW_KEYBOARD,
```
```
    // Hide **status bar**, **navigation bar**, and **IME** (everything). 
    SystemBarsAction.HIDE_ALL,
```
```
    // Show **status bar**, **navigation bar**, and **IME** (everything). 
    SystemBarsAction.SHOW_ALL
```
### Update Status Bar Themes:
#### For System Default to pick theme and apply to system bars don't pass the values.
```
controlSystemBars(
            type = SystemBarsAction.SHOW_SYSTEM_BARS,
            topInsetPadding = true,
            bottomInsetPadding = true
        )
```
#### To set custom status bar or nav bar theme color set as following:
```
// This will apply dark theme to status and navbar. Also can set false to apply light theme status 
// and navbar
controlSystemBars(
            type = SystemBarsAction.SHOW_SYSTEM_BARS,
            darkStatusBars = true,
            darkNavigationBars = true,
            topInsetPadding = true,
            bottomInsetPadding = true
        )
```
